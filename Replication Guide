# Replication Guide

This document provides a detailed explanation on how to replicate the Revised Optimized Model for Cosmological Magnetic Fields. It covers the following aspects:

## 1. Setting Up the Computational Environment

- **Hardware Requirements:**
  - High-Performance Computing (HPC) system or cluster with parallel processing capabilities (multi-core CPUs; GPUs if applicable).
- **Software Requirements:**
  - Operating System: Linux (preferred) or a compatible environment.
  - Compilers: C/C++/Fortran (if using compiled code).
  - Scripting: Python 3.x.
  - Required Libraries: MPI, OpenMP, BLAS, LAPACK, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, etc.
- **Installation:**
  - Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/RevisedOptimizedMagnetogenesisModel.git
    cd RevisedOptimizedMagnetogenesisModel
    ```
  - Install Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  - If applicable, compile the code:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

## 2. Detailed Configuration of Simulation Parameters

- **Input Files:**
  - The configuration files (e.g., `config/simulation_config.json`) contain parameters for each module:
    - **Subgrid Module:** Set the values for parameters such as `p`, `γ` (gamma), and define the temporal correction function `C(t)`.
    - **Feedback Module:** Configure the injection and removal coefficients (`λ_in(F,t)` and `λ_out(F,t)`) as well as the nonlinearity parameter `ν`.
    - **Reconnection Module:** Specify the functions `α(R,Γ)`, `β(R,Γ)`, the scaling factor `ξ`, and the nonlinear term `δ_NL(R,Γ)`.
    - **Chemical Network:** Input the parameters for H, He, H₂ and include the new parameters for the complex molecular reactions (e.g., formation and destruction rates of CO, H₂O, organic molecules).
- **Initial Conditions:**
  - Define the simulation box dimensions, boundary conditions, initial and final redshifts, and any other necessary physical parameters.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions for Running Simulations and Analyzing Data

1. **Launch the Simulation:**
   - Run the simulation using the provided script. For example:
     ```bash
     bash examples/run_simulation.sh
     ```
     or, if using Python:
     ```bash
     python code/main.py --config config/simulation_config.json
     ```
2. **Monitoring:**
   - The simulation output will be saved in the `data/simulation_results/` directory. Monitor the logs to check for convergence and any potential errors.
3. **Post-Processing and Data Analysis:**
   - Use the provided Jupyter Notebook (`examples/analysis_notebook.ipynb`) to analyze the simulation results. The notebook includes scripts to generate power spectra, spatial distribution plots, and Faraday rotation maps.
4. **Validation:**
   - Compare your simulation outputs with the reference results provided in the documentation to ensure that the model replicates correctly.
   - Follow the steps outlined in this guide to run convergence tests and benchmarking as described in the main documentation.

## 4. Troubleshooting and FAQs

- **Common Issues:**
  - If the simulation fails to converge, verify that the parameters in the configuration files are set within the recommended ranges.
  - Check that all dependencies are correctly installed and that your HPC environment meets the hardware requirements.
- **Further Assistance:**
  - For any issues not covered in this guide, please refer to the [User Manual](./user_manual.md) or open an issue on the GitHub repository.
