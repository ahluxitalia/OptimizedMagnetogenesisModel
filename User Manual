# User Manual

This manual provides a comprehensive overview of the Revised Optimized Model for Cosmological Magnetic Fields, including a detailed description of the model architecture, each of its modules, and instructions on how to interpret simulation results.

## 1. Overview of the Model Architecture

The model is composed of several integrated modules that work together to simulate the evolution of cosmological magnetic fields:
- **Subgrid Module:** Models the turbulent amplification of magnetic fields on sub-kiloparsec scales using an LES-MHD approach.
- **Astrophysical Feedback Module:** Implements a nonlinear model to simulate the injection and removal of magnetic energy due to energetic events such as supernovae and AGN jets.
- **Reconnection Module:** Utilizes a hybrid approach combining MHD corrections with PIC 3D simulations to handle collisionless and relativistic reconnection processes, with an extension into ultra-relativistic regimes (UltraUltraRel).
- **Advanced Chemical Network:** Incorporates a detailed chemical network that includes species such as H, He, H₂, metals, and dust, and has been updated to include complex molecular reactions (e.g., formation and destruction of molecules like CO, H₂O, organic molecules).

## 2. Detailed Module Descriptions

### 2.1 Subgrid Module
- **Purpose:**  
  To simulate the amplification of magnetic fields on scales that are too small to be resolved directly.
- **Key Parameters:**
  - `p`: Exponent controlling the scale-dependence of the amplification.
  - `γ` (gamma): Compression factor.
  - `C(t)`: Temporal correction function ensuring convergence at each simulation time step.
- **Usage:**  
  Adjust these parameters in the configuration file to match your simulation requirements.

### 2.2 Astrophysical Feedback Module
- **Purpose:**  
  To account for the energy injection and removal due to supernovae, AGN jets, and other energetic events.
- **Key Parameters:**
  - `λ_in(F,t)`: Injection coefficient.
  - `λ_out(F,t)`: Removal coefficient.
  - `ν`: Nonlinearity parameter controlling the feedback dynamics.
- **Usage:**  
  Calibration of these parameters is crucial. Refer to the replication guide for suggested values based on observational data.

### 2.3 Reconnection Module
- **Purpose:**  
  To model the process of magnetic reconnection in both standard and ultra-relativistic regimes.
- **Key Parameters:**
  - `α(R,Γ)` and `β(R,Γ)`: Functions that determine the scaling of reconnection processes.
  - `ξ` and `δ_NL(R,Γ)`: Parameters for the nonlinear terms.
- **Usage:**  
  These parameters have been derived and validated through PIC 3D simulations. Adjust them only if necessary and consult the replication guide for details.

### 2.4 Advanced Chemical Network
- **Purpose:**  
  To simulate the chemical evolution of the plasma, including the formation and destruction of complex molecules.
- **Key Features:**
  - Includes species such as H, He, H₂, metals, and dust.
  - Updated to incorporate complex molecular reactions (e.g., formation of CO, H₂O, organic molecules; dissociation processes in high-radiation environments).
  - Dynamically defines the collisionless threshold `ρ_c` based on the chemical composition.
- **Usage:**  
  Set the chemical parameters in the configuration file according to your simulation scenario.

## 3. Running the Model

- **Execution:**  
  Run the main simulation script as described in the [Replication Guide](./replication_guide.md).
- **Monitoring:**  
  Monitor the output logs and verify that the simulation progresses as expected.
- **Post-Processing:**  
  Use the provided analysis scripts (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks in the `examples/` folder) to visualize and interpret the simulation results.

## 4. Interpreting the Results

- **Output Data:**
  - Simulation results are stored in the `data/simulation_results/` directory.
  - Key outputs include power spectra, spatial distributions of the magnetic field, and Faraday rotation maps.
- **Analysis:**
  - Compare the simulation outputs with observational data to assess the accuracy of the model.
  - Use the analysis tools provided to examine the effects of different parameters on the evolution of the magnetic field.

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues:**
  - Check the configuration files for parameter consistency if the simulation does not converge.
  - Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and that the computational environment meets the required specifications.
- **Further Help:**
  - Refer to the [Replication Guide](./replication_guide.md) for detailed setup instructions.
  - For unresolved issues, please open an issue on the repository's GitHub page or contact the project maintainers.
