## Description

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the **Revised Optimized Model** developed to study the evolution of cosmological magnetic fields. The model integrates multiple modules:
- **Subgrid Module:** Models turbulent amplification on sub-kiloparsec scales using an LES-MHD approach.
- **Astrophysical Feedback Module:** Implements a nonlinear model for feedback from events such as supernovae and AGN jets.
- **Reconnection Module:** Uses a hybrid approach combining MHD corrections with PIC 3D simulations, including an extension into ultra-relativistic regimes (UltraUltraRel).
- **Advanced Chemical Module:** Incorporates a chemical network that accounts for H, He, Hâ‚‚, metals, and dust, further updated to integrate even more complex molecular reactions (e.g., formation/destruction of complex molecules) to better represent conditions in extreme environments and at high redshift.

The model has been rigorously validated through convergence tests, benchmarking, sensitivity analyses, and comparisons with observational data (e.g., Faraday rotation and polarization maps).

## Requirements

- **Compilers/Interpreters:** 
  - C/C++/Fortran (if using compiled code)
  - Python 3.x (if using Python scripts)
- **Dependencies:** MPI, OpenMP, BLAS, LAPACK, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, etc.
- **Additional tools:** Git (for version control) and an HPC environment for large-scale simulations.
